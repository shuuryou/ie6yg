This is a patched version that supports unicode windows.

The patch is taken from:

http://www.vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Code/Libraries/Subclassing/SSubTimer/bugTrak17_1.html

Archived as "bugdesc.pdf" in this folder.

Another description of the problem is at:

Basically, you can't subclass a window using the relevant *A functions if it's a Unicode window. In that case you MUST use the *W functions. If you try to do it, the title bar starts becoming really funny dancing mojibake on OS like Win2K or WinXP.

The original author never implemented the fix. Because of that I also can't use the asm-stubbed version of SSubTimer either.
